                <h3>My Education</h3>
                <p>During the early years, I learned that I wanted to become a programmer. I was 
                    self-taught in C++, javascript, and mySQL. I learned by putting together different
                    private servers that used these languages. I enjoyed coding the programs and seeing 
                    the results. With this background, I decided to study for a Bachelor of Science in Management 
                    Information Systems.

                <p>I attended Grossmont Community College for a short time period before transferring
                    to Columbia College. While I was attending Grossmont, I was working full time at a
                    restaurant. The scheduling errors constantly conflicted with the classes that I had. 
                    Since I decided to take in-person classes, it was difficult when the job did not follow
                    the times that I was not allowed to work. For one of the classes I had only attended three
                    out of sixteen class sessions but managed to pass the class.

                <img alt = "Columbia College Photo" src = "src/images/ColumbiaCollege.jpg">
                <p>I chose Columbia College because it was a military friendly college as well as accredited.
                    When I decided to take this route, I made sure that I would be able to complete the full
                    degree online since I was working two full time jobs to pay for college. Since I had half 
                    the credits required to finish my Associate's degree when I transferred into the college,
                    I decided to take on two semesters with six classes each to be able to finish the Associate's 
                    degree by the time I arrived in Naples, Italy.

                <p>I made the decision to work towards preparing for the CompTIA exams. The preparation course 
                    tuition was covered through MyCAA's spouse career advancement. The courses would each be for
                    eight weeks. I would be partaking in the courses at California State University San Marcos
                    through online learning and virtual labs with virtual machines. I should be finishing with the 
                    courses by December 2020 and obtaining the certificates shortly after.
