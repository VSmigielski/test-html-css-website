        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <img alt = "Veronica McCormick" src="src/images/Paris.jpg">
        <p>My name is Veronica McCormick, soon to be Veronica Smigielski. 
            I am twenty-four years old. In January, my husband told me 
            that he wanted a divorce. Due to corona rising in the country 
            of Italy, movement had come to a halt on March 12th. There was 
            a lockdown until mid-June. I decided to fly to Belgium before 
            I left for the United States again; however, that was the 
            beginning of a new chapter. Since the beginning of July, I have 
            lived in Antwerp, Belgium. I have gotten my Czech citizenship 
            documents settled to be able to stay in Europe.</p>
        <p>I began my first Bachelor's degree in Management Information 
            Systems in 2017. I finished the degree in August 2020. I was 
            extremely excited to get into the programming field. Since finishing 
            my Bachelor's degree, I thought it would be best to complete a few 
            certifications to accompany my new degree. I began preparation courses
            for CompTIA Network+ at the end of August. My thirst for knowledge
            didn't stop there. I began questioning if I should continue with another
            Bachelor's degree or even go into my Master's. Overall, the final decision 
            was to begin another Bachelor's degree but in 
            Cybersecurity. I knew that I would be having a lot of school beginning in
            October since classes at Columbia College began October 26. My preparation
            courses for CompTIA A+ and Security+ would also begin at the end of 
            October. This would mean that I would be taking a total of four classes at once
            through three different colleges.</p>
        <p>During the summer, there was a bit of time when Europe's countries came off 
            of lockdown which meant a bit more traveling while I was in Belgium. I traveled 
            to Paris, Amsterdam, Brugge, and the Ardennes. I enjoyed the wild ride that flying
            to Belgium brought me. While I lived in Italy, I only went to Barcelona for 
            vacation. In retrospect, the divorce was the best thing that could have happened 
            to me to reignite the spark that I had for programming and travelling.</p>
